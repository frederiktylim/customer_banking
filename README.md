# Module 3 Challenge: customer_banking

# The purpose of this challenge was to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts, allowing users to enter account and CD information (starting balance, interest and month terms), for the program to calculate these and then provide updated balance information given these terms.

# The challenge also included referencing other python files outside of the "main" in order to create classes and functions in the operations of the balances and calculations.

# The steps included in developing this project:
# Creating the Savings and CD Account functions, creating the main functions for the user to input the necessary data for the calculations, creating the savings account function within which the balance and interest parameters are passed, interest calculated, savings account is updated and to perform similar operations for the CD Account Function and it's main function.


# A note on how this challenge was completed:
# As I am new to coding and finding the learning curve steept, I referenced a number of sources in the completion of this challenge. These sources are as follow:

# 1. A tutoring session through the EdEx platform with Paddington; This tutor helped me read through the code, understand what was being asked and in some cases where to find the necessary code and information - either from telling me some code snippets to use or referring directly to the activities from the Module 3 classwork. In some cases, I copy-and-pasted form this coursework.

# 2. I Googled terminoology to understand the function of different code elements and snippets.

# 3. I used ChatGPT as a reference to understand code snippets, blocks of code, syntax and to understand what code to use when I got stuck. I passed my code through ChatGPT for syntax editing as I was having difficulty with spacing, tabs, brackets, etc. I also copy-and-pasted some parts of the ChatGPT code into my challenge when I wasn't able to make it work properly.

# To the best of my recollection, the above - in addition to references to class notes and coursework materials - are the resrouces that I used in completing this challenge.
